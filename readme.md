#### By **Margaret Wairimu Kuria**

## Description

This is an application that handles management of every day tasks. A user can add and manage all their tasks using the application and with a lot of ease and has a user friendly interface.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

To-Do List application requires a HTML5 web browser of choice for the user to launch it.
You also need a server suporting apache and mysql.

## Behaviour Driven Development

The application functionality is mostly what is put into first consideration when developing the application. The application allows a user to register and log in using their credentials. Once logged in, the user can create a to-do task. The tasks created by a user appear on their Dashboard once they have logged in.
A user cannot create a to-do task unless they are logged in.
The application allows a user to also edit or delete a task and displays the timestamp of when each task was added.
The tasks added by each user are only visible to them.

## Technologies Used

The application is built on Laravel PHP Framework. The user interface also includes HTML styled with SASS. JavaScript is also used for the responsiveness across different devices.
